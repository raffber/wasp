Next Task
==========

 * test, test, test, test and write doc
 * port to windows


Bugs
=======

 * format_multiline_message does not split strings properly
 * sync on log => no ugly race conditions in output
 * in case of invalid json, ALWAYS raise ValueError! => replace assert with parse_assert


Lower Priorieties/Questions
============================

 * Popen(cwd='asdf') fuckup!?? -> this might need a rewrite of run() may do sth like sh -c 'cd .... ; $CMD'
 * binary json?! maybe implmented by myself?
 * yaml subset which can be translated to json
 * invocation from recursive directory: how to deduce topdir?!
 * simplify global bashcompletion activation
 * verbosity per decorator (use command class, assign all tasks their logger just after calling a command)
 * argumentprovider => register, such that retireve(asdf) works automatically by dispatching. => singledispatch?
 * util.Namespace class => inherit metadata, decoratorstore from it
 * improve ctx.commands API
 * escape : in filename (.replace('\:', ':') at str[0:1])
 * proper subproject handling (implemented as plugin to the recursion algorithm)
 * some way to make commands run again if specified implict as a dependency for another command and the former has already
   completed successfully. Use case might be an updated git repo which gets pulled in by "./wasp fetch" and should be updated
   regularly. => ctx.commands['configure'].invalidate(): REQUIRES: improved command api
 * could we integrate pip, easy_install? just install extensions as eggs? => test for import pip
   - if sth. is missing (e.g. templates, make it automatically installable)
   - install it to wasp temporary directory
   - if globally installed create wasp temporary directory
   - pip install --install-option="--prefix=$PREFIX_PATH" package_name


Global Installation and call from subdirectory
==============================================

note, that at the moment global installation of wasp is not possible
The implementation of this ``feature`` does not have particular priority, since
it is not the intended design of wasp. Though it might be useful for performance enhancement.

 * make sure local install has precedence over global install
 * subfiles must know the the topdir
 * with each command, save its origin with inspect.<whatever>()
 * if invoked in a subdir, only execute the commands in there
 * in wasp.fs: how to deduce topdir?!


subproject Extension
------------------

 * think about plugin api such that possible, what kind of hooks are required?
 * automatically add options for activating subprojects
 * wasp.subproject.activate.only('doc') or wasp.subproject.activate.except('doc')
 * same with deactivate
 * options --<subprojname> and --no-<subprojname> --all --none

Extensions
-----------

 * templates (fetch using git from external repo, copy over, keep a template-readme.txt)
    - register a command init-template
 * gui (tkinter)
    - run commands
    - edit arguments => use a visitor for option types and support single dispatch to extend
    - display depenency tree?!
 * think about background daemons (daemon autostart extension?!) Daemon('adsf').ensure_running().produce(':daemon')
    --> openocd
    --> gdb server


Declarative
============

 * declarative tag handlers => register with factory
 * use yaml or json as markup - yaml has dependency ;(
 * run in init handler wasp.run_declarative('build.yml', format=None) infers format with 'json' => json, 'yml' => yaml
